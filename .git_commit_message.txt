- Enhanced the interactive PCD viewer in `visualize_depth_comparison.py` with:
    - Toggleable display modes (all PCDs vs. depth-filtered PCDs).
    - Improved panning and zooming performance by pre-rendering images.
    - Display of camera and world coordinates on mouse hover.
- Refactored and renamed reference modules in the `ref` directory to follow `ref_` prefix convention.
- Updated `GEMINI.md` with new instructions.
